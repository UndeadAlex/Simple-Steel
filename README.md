# Simple-Steel

I orginally created this mod all the way back for 1.12

I stopped development to focus on my university, however in my free time i might update and maintain this mod.

If you have any changes feel free to use this :)

## Reflection
**I've been told to reflect more.**

I don't remember a HUGE amount about this old mod of mine, i remember it was made because i just really wanted steel ingots for modpacks that made it really hard, but not much else, i learnt alot from doing this mod, i never fully continued modding minecraft but it allowed me to understand alot of concepts for programming and understanding industry standards and coding concepts atleast for mojang.

anyway, im done here.. well done reflecting and stuff.
